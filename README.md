## Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment Analysis projects that I have done using python. 
Used a variety of libraries including sklearn, pandas, and nltk.

## Naive Bayes (GaussianNB)

Using naive bayes classifier, I seperated data into test and train data to predict outcomes of text. 
In this example I used restaurant reviews as either good or bad and predicted using training data

## Logical Regression 

Using a linear regression classifier, plotted points in a line in order to use a regression model to 
predict if a certain review was good or bad.
